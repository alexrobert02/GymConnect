# GymConnect
Bachelor Thesis Project 2024

## Description
GymConnect offers a comprehensive web application tailored for gym-goers of all levels. It provides a robust platform for users to search and access detailed information about a wide variety of fitness exercises, making it an invaluable resource for those new to the fitness world. Users can easily create and modify personalized workouts, ensuring convenient access to their routines.

Additionally, the app offers advanced features for dedicated gym-goers, including the ability to generate custom workouts from scratch. By inputting key details such as age, frequency of workouts per week, and fitness goals, users can receive tailored workout plans designed to meet their specific needs.

The user-friendly interface of GymConnect ensures that navigating through the vast array of exercises and workout plans is seamless. The app categorizes exercises based on muscle groups, equipment, and difficulty levels, allowing users to find exactly what they need with ease. Each exercise is accompanied by detailed instructions, video demonstrations, and tips for proper form to maximize effectiveness and minimize the risk of injury.

GymConnect's backend infrastructure consists in a robust microservices architecture, ensuring scalability, resilience, and flexibility. This architecture breaks down the application into small, manageable services that operate independently. Each microservice is responsible for specific functionality within the application, such as user authentication, workout plan generation, exercise database management and workout database management.
